A simple Java console-based Number Guessing Game - "Deepu's Number Guessing Game."

## Introduction

Welcome to "Deepu's Number Guessing Game"! This is a fun and interactive Java console-based game where the player tries to guess a random number generated by the computer. The game offers three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard) and keeps track of the player's score. The player can play as many rounds as they like and try to beat their highest score.

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, it will ask you to select a difficulty level:
   - Easy: The secret number will be between 1 and 100, and you'll have 5 attempts to guess it.

   - Hard: The secret number will be between 1 and 1016, and you'll have 3 attempts to guess it.

2. After selecting the difficulty level, the game will generate a secret number, and you need to guess it by entering a number within the specified range.

3. The game will provide feedback after each guess:
   - "Too low! Try again." if your guess is lower than the secret number.
   - "Too high! Try again." if your guess is higher than the secret number.
   - "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number!" if you guess the correct number.
